In C we have three different loop types available: while, do .. while, and for. In order
to compare them and find the advantages and disadvantages of each, you should implement
each of the following tasks three times using every loop type for each task:

a) Write a loop that prints the numbers 0, . . . , 100 to the console.
b) Read a number from the user, and write as many ’*’ symbols to the console as given
by the user.
c) Read a single character from the user and continue until the user enters ’q’ or ’Q’.
Think about the loop types: which loop is best suited for which task?
